Aggregation
===

Hello there! I'm a theme for aggregating content from multiple RSS sources. I'm lean, mean, and fast!

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the most recent ZIP version of Aggregation from GitHub.
2. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
3. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
4. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
5. You'll be prompted to install required plugins and recommended plugins.

Setting Up the Theme
---------------

Once installed, you can easily customize this theme to your hearts content! Here's how:

1. Click on Site Settings, which is located just below  Appearance.
2. On the site settings page you can change the layout of the site, add logos, favicons, custom code, copyright information, and social network profiles.
3. Now click on Homepage under Site Settings. These are the bones of the theme and where the awesome aggregation takes place! Included in the tab are instructions on how to easily setup the shortcode.
4. Moving onto Typography. From this page you can change fonts, font styles, and font sizes!
5. And last, but not least, we have the Colors options page. Here you can change the main and secondary colors for the site, the main menu background, and the footer background colors.
